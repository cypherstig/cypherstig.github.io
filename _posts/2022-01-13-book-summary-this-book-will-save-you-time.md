## Chapter 1: Money Rich, Time Poor

- Society greatly underestimates the value of time.
	- Most people voluntarily sacrifice time in exchange for money or due to social pressures.
- People spend a majority of their days "working," a term that has become synonymous with duties that are mindless, boring, and unejoyable.
- Time is the opportunity cost of earning a fat paycheck by climbing the corporate ladder.
- **Opportunity cost**: Sum of the potential gain that could have been earned by the alternatives of a given decision.
- Time is the most valuable and strictly limited resource you have: can't buy it, can't make more of it. Once it's gone, it's gone forever.
- What good is wealth, if you don't have time?
- <mark>True wealth is an abundance of free time, which can be converted into anything.</mark>

## Chapter 2: Time Theft

- When someone wastes or steals time from you, it is the same or worse than if they stole your money or property.
	- Unlike money or property, time can't be created or acquired.
	- Examples: 10 people spending an hour in a useless meeting is 10 hours wasted. Somebody is extremely late, or food at a restaurant takes too long.
		- What could you have done with this time wasted/stolen? Read, spent time with loved ones, made money. Possibilities with free time are endless.
- <mark>Average life expectancy is 70 years (600,000 hours, and roughly 1/3rd of that time is spent sleeping), so when somebody wastes an hour of your time, they micromurder 1/600,000th of you.</mark>

> "You are nothing but a number of days, and whenever a day passes away, a part of you passes away." -Hasan Al-Basri

- People will only waste your time if they see that you don't value it enough.
	- Once you start valuing your time, happiness and productivity will increase because you will be more selective about the things that you do and the people you choose to spend your time with.

> "Life, if well lived, is long enough." -Seneca

## Chapter 3: Got a minute?

- Living in an attention economy, protecting your time is more relevant now than ever.
- **Attention economy**: Every single website, news agency, social media platform, celebrity, and YouTuber is fighting for your time and attention.
<a href="#citations"><img class="post-header-image-right portrait standard-img-border" src="/assets/img/this-book-will-save-you-time/distracted-cat.gif" alt="Distracted cat"></a>
- Attention is a limited resource, and there are rewards for capturing it, which is why multi-billion dollar companies like Meta and Alphabet maximize and monetize every second of it.
	- <mark>Websites like Facebook, Instagram, and YouTube are not free. You pay with your most limited resource: time.</mark>

> "If you're not paying for it, you're the product." -Misir Mahmudov

- You would expect journalists and news agencies to optimize for accuracy and speediness of information provided, but instead, the priority is to get you to spend as much of your time as possible watching or reading their content.
	- Correct information is boring. Conversely, twisted and manipulated information can cause hysteria and controversy, and get clicks and views (attention) that can be monetized.
	- Incentives are misaligned, and are a recipe for outrage culture.

## Chapter 4: You Assign Value to Your Time

- Your time is worth as much as you want it to be, and depends on your choices and actions.
	- Example: If time is spent productively -- mastering a skill, adding qualifications, or building a business -- you can significantly increase the value of your time. 
		- If you assign your time a high value, you will spend it wisely and not allow people to waste it. If you don't respect your time, you won't do much with it.
		- <mark>You can make your time worthless or infinitely valuable. Choose wisely.</mark>

## Chapter 5: The Business of Time Saving

- Frequent use of on-demand services like Uber, or fast food chains like McDonald's shows humans' willingness to pay if their time is respected and saved.
- Time-savings-based ideation is the process of looking for solutions that could shorten the amount of time required to perform a certain task (like this book summary!).
	- The time-savings business is huge, and creating a product that will save people 10 minutes when performing a certain routine task could turn into a billion dollar business.

## Chapter 6: Time and Savings

- Money can be seen as a representation of time that is easier to exchange:
	- We exchange our time in return for money that we can use later.
	- If you earned enough money in the past, you can afford not to work and enjoy your free time in the future.
- In order to live life well, you must minimize the amount of time spent doing things you don't enjoy, or, maximize time spent doing things you love. This can be achieved through savings.
- <mark>Saving money means buying a stake in your future time and reserving it for a possibility to do enjoyable things with it, instead of being obliged to work from 9 to 5.</mark>
- Saving wealth into the future is particularly difficult in modern society, as we are constantly pushed towards consumption.
	- Instant gratification, consumer culture, inflation, and excessive commercialization, combined with marketers, politicians, economists, and celebrities urging us to spend instead of save.
- **Inflation**: Decrease in purchasing power per unit of a currency, over time.
- **Purchasing power**: The value, as measured in goods or services, that one unit of a currency can buy.
- **Instant gratification**: Giving up future benefit in order to earn a less rewarding, but more immediate benefit.
- <mark>Going into debt (spending beyond your means) is the opposite of savings. You are giving up future time in order to consume something today.</mark>
	- Future time is consumed by simply having to work to pay bills or past loans, as most people don't have savings. (40% of Americans don't even have $400 for emergency expenses.)
- Savings help free your time because they free you from the necessity of having to work.
	- For every future day of freedom that your savings can afford, you are giving yourself an extra 8 hours that would otherwise be spent working.

> "A wise savings strategy can get you a third of your remaining lifetime back." -Misir Mahmudov

<a href="#citations"><img class="post-fullwidth-image standard-img-border" src="/assets/img/this-book-will-save-you-time/shocked-owl.gif" alt="Shocked owl"></a>

- In addition to savings, another method to free up time is passive income. 
- **Passive income**: A source of recurring income that does not require the constant effort of a full-time job. 
	- Example: Owning a condo (form of savings), and renting it out for a monthly fee (passive income).

## Chapter 7: Time on Your Hands

- Prices rise (inflation) because as banks print more of a currency and increase the total supply, each unit of that currency is devalued.
	- Alternate example: Owning a limited edition baseball card that has only 10 copies in existence is far more valuable than owning a baseball card that has 1,000,000 copies. 
	- This forces sellers to raise prices for goods and services in order make the same amount of money as before.
- <mark>Money as we know it today fails to represent time because time is limited, while fiat money is not.</mark>
- **Fiat**: Government-regulated currency that is backed by faith in the issuing government, instead of an asset.
	- When you work, you are exchanging time (the most fundamentally limited resource), for money (whose amount always increases). You are giving away something absolutely limited for something infinitely unlimited.
	- Our time is absolutely limited, so when trading time for money, we should receive something similarly scarce in return.
- As the number of units of a currency increases, your savings in that currency loses value because they now represent a smaller share of the constantly increasing total supply. 
	- This makes it harder to retire because your savings is constantly losing value.
	- In order to live off savings, the purchasing power of your savings needs to increase at a rate higher than the inflation rate. 
- <mark>Your time is absolutely limited, so when you work and exchange your time, you want to get something similarly valuable in return.</mark>
	- It is wise to hold wealth in limited assets that are better at storing value over time, such as real estate.
		- Over the years, wealth held in cash will lose value as more dollars enter the system, whereas real estate is likely to maintain value, given that it is a limited resource.

> "Why should you exchange your limited time for a currency that is unlimited?." -Misir Mahmudov

## Chapter 8: Time and Money

- Infinite goods, or goods with an easily expandable supply, do not function well as money.
	- Somebody will always find a way to create more of this good and thereby make their share of wealth larger, enriching themselves at the cost of everyone else.
	- Prices of other goods and services in the economy rise as vendors and producers require more of this expandable monetary good to cover costs, now that its value has decreased. 
- **Hyperinflation**: A phenomenon where the supply of money increases so fast that the prices of goods and services rise quickly, essentially making the currency worthless over a very short period of time.
- For money to work well, it has to exist in a limited supply. Money should be scarce, just like time.
- A variety of limited goods have served the role of money throughout history, only to eventually be exploited and devalued by increasing supply (stones, shells, glass beads, cows, metals, etc.).
	- Example: Locals on Yap island in the Pacific used Rai stones as their currency, as it was very scarce on the island. Eventually, Rai stones were imported to the island in exchange for labor, inflating supply and devaluing the local currency until it was eventually worthless.
- Properties of monetary goods that fulfill money's store of value and medium of exchange functionalities: scarcity, durability, portability, fungibility, verifiability, divisibility, and established history.
- **Fungibility**: The characteristic of an asset that determines how freely it can be exchanged with other similar assets. 
- **Scarcity**: The characteristic of an asset that determines the gap between the demand for that asset, and its available supply.
	- Scarcity is the most important property for good money that preserves its value. Otherwise, its supply will inevitably increase, causing it to lose value.  

- The world eventually adopted gold as the global monetary standard in the 19th century because it is the scarcest stable element in Earth's crust, meaning that gold is a physical good whose supply is the most difficult to increase.
- **The Gold Standard**: A monetary system whereby a country's money supply is directly linked to the value of its gold reserves.
- Gold has been mined for thousands of years, and remains to be a very expensive process. There is no individual or country that could arbitrarily increase the amount of gold they own and thus make it lose value.
- Even when more gold is mined, the new supply is tiny compared to existing stockpiles that have been mined throughout history, allowing gold to have strong immunity against inflation and devaluation.
- For small purchases and daily trade, people used other metals that were less scarce and less valuable, such as silver and copper.
- As gold and other metals eventually became impractical to use, the world shifted to paper money backed by gold or silver.
	- Paper money used to be receipts representing certain quantities of scarce metals like gold that were stored in warehouses.
	- Each paper receipt was redeemable for the equivalent amount of gold, and this direct link to a scarce good gave value to otherwise infinite and valueless pieces of paper.
	- It was easier to trade with paper receipts instead of carrying different weights of metals.
- _Fun fact_: The British Pound sterling is derived from a pound (weight unit) of sterlings (silver coins)
- A country could only have the amount of money equal to the amount of gold they owned. If a country wanted to create more money, they would first have to acquire more gold, which was scarce and expensive.
- The Gold Standard capped any nation's ability to inflate their money and thereby devalue each unit of the currency, allowing people to store their wealth in the currency without worrying about wealth shrinkage.

- In 1971, Richard Nixon abandoned the Gold Standard, canceling the tie between paper money and gold. 
	- Gold reserves no longer limited nations' ability to create more of their currency, meaning countries could arbitrarily increase total money supply.
- As the amount of currency (dollars) in circulation increases, the value of each individual dollar falls.
<a href="#citations"><img class="post-fullwidth-image standard-img-border" src="/assets/img/this-book-will-save-you-time/USD-pp-vs-currency-circulation.jpg" alt="USD purchasing power vs currency in circulation"></a>
- Purchasing power decreased by more than 5 times between 1971 and 2006, and is directly related to currency inflation.
	- $20 in 2006 was worth $100 in 1971
	- A million dollar New York Apartment today would have costed under $40,000 in 1971.
- US money supply was $7 billion in 1900. By 2010, it grew to $13,291 billion (1,900x more dollars in circulation), immensly devaluing each dollar.
- Corporations try to hide the effects of currency devaluation via shrinkflation.
- **Shrinkflation**: As inflation causes currencies to lose value over time, producers of goods reduce the size and quality of their products to somewhat maintain prices.
	- Example: [Snickers bar (BBC, 2018)](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-42864685)
	- Also seen with toilet paper, meat, bread, etc.

- <mark>How can anyone save money if even the most successful currency in history, the British pound, has lost over 99.5% of its original value?</mark>
	- Gold is not the answer, as storing and transporting it is difficult, and it is easily confiscatable. Ownership has been limited or banned in decades past (for example, in 1933 President Roosevelt made it illegal for Americans to own gold), even though central banks around the world continue to hoard gold in their vaults.
- People with access to relatively stable currencies such as the US dollar and the Euro are privileged, as they preserve value far better than most currencies. For example, the Venezuelan Bolivar lost 96% of its value in 2017 alone due to hyperinflation.
	- Even "stable" currencies losing 5% in value per year will take only 15 years to lose over 50% in value due to the compounding effect.
		- The official "target" inflation rate in the US (one of the strongest economomies in the world) is 2%, but calculating inflation is a biased process using the Consumer Price Index (CPI), a soft science allowing room for manipulation and underestimation of real inflation.
- **Consumer Price Index (CPI)**: A controversial measurement, with an ever-evolving calculation, intended to estimate the average change in prices over time that consumers pay for a basket of goods and services. <a href="#citations">(Investopedia, 2021)</a>
- Inability for the common person to store wealth without losing a significant amount of purchasing power is one of the main reasons why most people are forced to work until old age, with minimal savings.

## Chapter 9: Bitcoin and Time

- Bitcoin is a decentralized digital currency without a central authority.
	- Conversely, modern currencies rely on central figures for money issuance and transaction management.
		- Bitcoin uses cryptography to decentralize these processes, allowing the network to collectively fulfill them.
- **Cryptography**: The mathematical and computational practice of encoding and decoding data. <a href="#citations">(Investopedia, 2021)</a>
- Bitcoin is a permissionless and borderless money that can be sent over the internet to anyone in the world at any time.
- <mark>Only 21 million bitcoins will ever exist and it is the first currency ever with absolute scarcity.</mark>
- Instead of trusting any 3rd party (bank, country, person, etc.), Bitcoin uses math, game-theory, self-interest, and thermodynamics to secure itself, ensuring strict scarcity and immutability.
- **Immutability**: Having the charactistic of being unchangeable.
- The Bitcoin network is decentralized and distributed amongst hundreds of thousands of unrelated people (and their computers) around the world.
	- If anyone tried to unfavorably change or harm Bitcoin, other participants in the decentralized system would simply block them, preserving the integrity of Bitcoin.
- In the modern world, you are always at the mercy of the inflation rate. History shows that you cannot trust banks with the money supply. If you had the ability to create money for whatever expenses you have, wouldn't you do it?
<a href="#citations"><img class="post-header-image-right portrait standard-img-border" src="/assets/img/this-book-will-save-you-time/money-printer-brr.gif"></a>
- <mark>Bitcoin is the first money allowing you to trade your only truly valuable asset (limited time) for similarly scarce units of value (bitcoin).</mark>

## Chapter 10: A Promising Future

- Bitcoin's adoption has seen massive growth since its inception over a decade ago. Price and network capacity have been steadily rising as more people use, run, and build on top of Bitcoin.
- <mark>A Bitcoin world with finite money would allow people to build the same amount of wealth in a fraction of the time it would take in a world where money is subject to loss of purchasing power.</mark>
	- People would be able to afford more and retire much earlier than they do in today's world.
- When the money you earn loses value over time through inflation, people are indirectly stimulated to spend it earlier than later, birthing consumer culture, as saving money becomes less effective, and debt becomes a widespread tendency. 
- In a future where money is finite like time, people would be more likely to have savings.
	- <mark>Savings and capital growth are crucial to progress and global prosperity, as savers have more time to find wise investment opportunities that will profit them and society in the long run.</mark>
- A society with finite money will allow people to have more free time, an important component in the manifestation and development of an individual's creativity and innovation.
- Finite money can help reduce global wealth inequality, as the average person today is overly dependent on the currency they are paid in, and owns very little value in wealth-preserving assets (equity, real estate, etc.)
	- With a strictly limited money supply, people's wealth will not be victim to the redistributive effects of inflation that cause the stock and real estate markets to appreciate at the expensve of a currency.
-Finite money encourages delaying gratification, pushing people to pursue productive, long-term endeavors, as they wouldn't be pressured to spend their depreciating money as quickly as possible.
- **Delayed gratification**: Sacrificing a reward that could be granted immediately, in anticipation of a greater reward in the future.

## Chapter 11: The Currency of Life

- <mark>Finite nature is the most fundamental (and strangely, undervalued) quality of life. Each of us has a strictly limited amount of time to value and cherish everything this world has to offer. Finding motivation would be difficult if you lived forever.</mark>
- Valuing your time is the first step to loving yourself.
