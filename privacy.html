<h2>Privacy Policy</h2>

<div class="standard-container">
    <p>Cypherstig is especially committed to user privacy. Our commitment aligns well with that of the American Library Association, as articulated in their <a href='http://www.ala.org/advocacy/intfreedom/librarybill' target='_blank'>Library Bill of Rights</a> and <a href='https://www.ala.org/Template.cfm?Section=interpretations&Template=/ContentManagement/ContentDisplay.cfm&ContentID=34182' target='_blank'>Interpretation</a> (as they were written in September 2017).</p>

    <p>In general, we don't want your data. Cypherstig is a content provider, and its users are consumers—not the other way around.</p>

    <h4>Information We Collect: Website</h4>
    <p>We use Google Analytics on the website to measure vital performance metrics (mainly traffic & conversions).</p>

    <p>If you join our mailing list, we store your email address to send you periodic emails. We do not attempt to connect any data (e.g., from analytics, app usage, etc) to email addresses. Therefore unsubscribing from the email list is the only thing you need to do to completely remove yourself from our records.</p>

    <h4>How We Use This Information</h4>
    <p>All the information we collect, as anonymous and vague as it is, is kept in strict confidence. We don't work with any ad networks or third-party services for the app. Otherwise, the site uses Google Analytics, and we use MailChimp to send email newsletters.</p>

    <h4>Revisions</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>There have been no revisions made at this time.</li>
    </ul>
